snes9x (Super Nintendo Entertainment System emulator)

Snes9x is a portable, freeware Super Nintendo Entertainment System
(SNES) emulator. It basically allows you to play most games designed
for the SNES and Super Famicom Nintendo game systems on your PC or
Workstation. The games include some real gems that were only ever
released in Japan.

When you first run snes9x:

- The first thing you'll want to do is configure the controls. By
  default there are *no* controls set up; you'll be unable to play any
  games! The config is under Options -> Preferences, in the Joypads
  tab. You can configure either keyboard or joystick/gamepad controls,
  but not both.

- If the game audio is choppy or distorted, try setting the
  sound driver to Pulse or ALSA (Options -> Preferences -> Sound
  tab). Specifically, avoid SDL audio (unfortunately it's the default
  if PULSE=no).  Most importantly set your playback rate to match 
  whatever you have set as your default sameple rate. If you don't
  know what your soundcards sample rate is you can play an audio
  file or a youtube video then in a terminal launch this command
  to show you what your sample rate is.
  watch -n1 cat /proc/asound/card?/pcm0p/sub0/hw_params
  with ? being your soundcards position, 0,1,2,3 etc.
  to find this information use aplay -l

Notes:

- The package can optionally include the snes9x libretro core, for use
  with RetroArch. By default, the core will be built if RetroArch is
  installed. You can set RETROARCH=yes to force the core to be built,
  or RETROARCH=no to forcibly disable the core. Note that RetroArch
  doesn't have to be installed to build the libretro core, but it's
